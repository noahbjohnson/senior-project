  <p># Analysis of National Correlates of Tourist Industry Activity
Proposal prepared by Noah B Johnson for Data Science senior project at Luther College</p>
<p>## Introduction
Tourism is often regarded as a positive force for its perceived effects on economic development, modernization, and globalization of destination populations. Much of the analysis of this issue relies on a number of assumptions about the nature of ‘development’ and its accoutrement. Significant relationships are often taken out of context or extrapolated inappropriately. The purpose of this analysis is to identify other correlations with tourist activity to provide further context to relationships and demonstrate the limitations of underlying assumptions.</p>
<p>## Methods
Data on tourism activity will be analyzed with data on topics of national importance. Indicators will be normalized and used for linear regression with tourism metrics as the response.</p>
<p>$$
y=beta 0 +beta 1x1 +beta2x2 + beta kxkdots + epsilon
$$</p>
<p>Further analysis will be done on categorizing countries using k-means clustering with and without response variables.</p>
<p>$$
mathcal{U}^* =
text{arg}min_{hspace{-1in}phantom{hat{U}}Uinmathcal{P}},max_{c_kinchi}
sum_{k=1}^C sum_{i=1}^n
U_{k,i} ||c_k - vec {x}_i||_d^2
$$</p>
<p>More advanced data mining techniques may be used to further analyze any interesting relationships identified in preliminary linear regressions and to identify complex interactions or clusters.</p>
<p>To provide context and control for the factor analysis, basic relationships between traditional national economic indicators and tourism information will also be modeled and presented.</p>
<p>## Data Collection and Management
Data will be downloaded directly when available, or through APIs if not. Country names will be cleaned to ISO standards to assist in comparison.</p>
<p>The Tourism data set will be used as a master table that the other data is left joined onto. This means that countries and regions in the issue data may not be included in the analysis if there is not comparable entries on the master table.</p>
<p>A final full dataset will be created including all of the issue-based data and the master table. This dataset will be used for most of the advanced data mining and model training.</p>
<p>## Issues &amp; Data Sources
Below are the issues that will be analyzed, as well as sources for data that have been identified so far. Those issues without data sources will be analyzed if reliable data can be found. Each issue will be independently analyzed prior to combination for more advanced data mining.</p>
